Files for getting a working environment for web developers based on the ubuntu server 16.04. Includes fully customized Linux, Apache, MySQL, with PHP 7, xdebug, phpmyadmin. Using this, you can set up the working environment in a few minutes. Ideal for both beginners and experienced developers.

These are the files to my article in which I am telling for beginners about the phased setup of the PHPStorm development environment for learning HTML, CSS, PHP on Windows (the very article on Vagrant and PHPStorm is available at  https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-panov-04071b147	"My profile on LinkedIn")
